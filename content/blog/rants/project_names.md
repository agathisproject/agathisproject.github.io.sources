  The Projects Need Proper Names
---

- The work around here is organized in projects, each one with its own repository; they **must** be uniquely identified.
- Using the description of the project as its name is a horrible idea.
- The project names must have some level of consistency; numbers, or other random codes are out of the question.
- Choosing a project name should be an easy task - as easy as pick one from a list.
- Need a pool of project names lager than 1000.
- I like trees.

### **I decided:**

#### 1. The projects **shall** be named from the list of practical unlimited supply provided by the [List of trees and shrubs by taxonomic family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_trees_and_shrubs_by_taxonomic_family). The list is 1351 long, plenty to choose from.

#### 2. The repository name **shall** be same as the project name.

#### 3. The name **shall**  use the latin variant with a hyphen as in *juniperus-ashey*.

#### 4. No tree is above others - in other words, bigger is not better. Distinctive or more different is.

#### 5. Look at the names already in use, choose a good one and easy to remember name, or ask for help.

#### 6. Each project name goes through one month trial period - if something sounds/looks/feels out of place about the name, then pick another name. Anyone can share their opinion, but I will take the final decision.

#### 7. Some project names need to be supported with a short descriptive name until they grow stronger and get a general recognition on their own (ex: ficus-elastica workflow)

#### 8. Until a more suitable process is introduced, I will rule and take responsibility on any issues related to project naming.
