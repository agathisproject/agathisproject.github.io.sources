  The work branch created on github
---

- Created the *work* branch in repository [ficus-elastica](https://github.com/agathisproject/ficus-elastica) to start documenting the **workflow on Agathis Projects**.

- After creative work is completed, there will be a pull request to validate the doc set and eventually merge the branch into the *master* branch.

- Note the *master* branch of the git is reserved for releases through a pull request review process.
